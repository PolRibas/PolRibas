# Hi, I'm Pol! 👋

### A bit about me
- **CTO & Founder** at [**Piar Concept**](https://piarconcept.com) (my own ideas & tech lab).
- **Head of Communication & Brand Development** at [**Catalònia Hoquei Club**](https://cataloniahoqueiclub.com)
  - Redesigned the club's identity and website, organizing events and projects to keep the hockey spirit alive.
- Previously worked as a full-stack developer with **ISDIN** and **Amphora**, enhancing performance, launching platforms, and driving digital transformation.

### What I do
- Blend **creativity and technology** to solve problems innovatively.
- Love working with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Docker**, **AWS**, and methodologies like **Domain-Driven Design** and **Clean Architecture**.
- Passionate about crafting beautiful interfaces and robust backends that simplify lives.

### My mantra
> “If you can imagine it, you can build it. No limits, no fear.”
